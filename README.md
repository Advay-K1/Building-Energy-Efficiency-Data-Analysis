Project Title: Residential Building Energy Efficiency Analysis
Overview
The increasing global concern over climate change has heightened the need for constructing energy-efficient buildings. With more than 50% of residential energy consumption attributed to heating and cooling, accurately determining the energy efficiency of a building during the planning phase is crucial. This project focuses on analyzing UC Irvine's dataset on residential housing structures, aiming to predict heating and cooling loads based on various features.

Dataset
Description
The dataset comprises 768 samples of residential buildings. The primary objective is to predict two key variables: heating load (energy input) and cooling load (energy output). The prediction relies on eight features, each providing valuable insights into the characteristics of the buildings.

Features
Relative Compactness
Surface Area - m²
Wall Area - m²
Roof Area - m²
Overall Height - m
Orientation - 2:North, 3:East, 4:South, 5:West
Glazing Area - 0%, 10%, 25%, 40% (of floor area)
Glazing Area Distribution (Variance) - 1:Uniform, 2:North, 3:East, 4:South, 5:West
Target Variables
Heating Load - kWh
Cooling Load - kWh
